# Homework: JavaScript loops

## The even/odd reporter

Write a `for` loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen (e.g. "2 is even").

## Multiplication Tables

Write a `for` loop that will iterate from 1 to 12. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").

**Bonus**: Use a nested `for` loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 12.

## The Grade Assigner

Use the grade assigner code you wrote from the conditionals exercises for every value from 60 to 100 - so your log should show "For 89, you got a B. For 90, you got an A.", etc.

## Golf

Using the Golf condition you made before in the conditionals exercise, log out the nickname of every score from 1 to 8 on a par 5 hole

**Bonus**: Use a nested for loop to run the same piece of code, but with par changing from 3 to 5

**Bonus**: Generate a random par for each iteration

## 99 Bottles of Beer

Write a script that prints the lyrics to "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" in the terminal. If you're unfamiliar with the song, you can find the lyrics [here](http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/lyrics.html).

Make sure your program can handle both singular and plural cases (i.e. both "100 bottles of beer" and "1 bottle of beer").
