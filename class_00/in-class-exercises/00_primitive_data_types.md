# Exercises: Primitive Data Types

## How would you?

1. Convert a string into a number (e.g. `"4"` into `4`)?
2. Convert a number into a string (e.g. `15` into `"15"`)?
3. Make a string uppercased (e.g. `"hello"` into `"HELLO"`)?
4. Get the second character out of a string (e.g.`"hello"` returns `"e"`)?
5. Use concatenation to combine two strings (e.g. join `"Hello "` and `"World"`)?
6. Get a number and square it (e.g. `4` squared is `16`)?
7. Get the square root of a number (e.g. square root of `25` is `5`)?
