# Exercises: Conditionals

## What number's bigger?

Write an `if` statement that compares two numbers (call them `numOne` and `numTwo`).

If numOne is bigger, it should log to the console `"numOne (THE VALUE) is bigger than numTwo (THE VALUE)"`.

If numTwo is bigger, it should log to the console `"numOne (THE VALUE) is smaller than numTwo (THE VALUE)"`.

If they are even, it should log to the console `"numOne (THE VALUE) is equal to numTwo (THE VALUE)"`.

## Driving Age

Store the user's name and age.

- If the age is less than 16, log `"Sorry, you can't drive yet!"`
- If the age is greater than or equal to 16, log `"Drive into the sunset!"`

**Bonus**: Get the name and age using `prompt`!

**Bonus**: If the user can't drive yet, tell them how many years they have before they can drive (e.g. `"Sorry, you still have 4 years before you can drive"`)
