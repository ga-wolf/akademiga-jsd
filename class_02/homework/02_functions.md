# Exercises: Functions

These exercises are based on the variables exercises, so you may start from your solutions or start from scratch.

Note that if you think the data would be best stored in another way (i.e. using arrays or objects) - go right ahead! e.g. the World Translator might have some data that looks like this:

```js
const translations = {
  eng: "Hello World",
  fr: "Bonjour le Monde"
  // ...
};
```

## Driving Age

- Write a function that receives a `userAge` called `canDrive`
  - If the received age is less than 16, print `"Sorry, you can't drive yet"`
  - If the received age is equal to or over 16, print `"Drive away!"`

**Bonus**: If the user can't drive yet, tell them how many years they will have to wait (e.g. `"Sorry, you have 4 years to wait until you can drive"`)

## The World Translator

Write a function called `translator` that receives a language (e.g. "fr", "eng" etc.). Log out the translated version (e.g. if the language is `"eng"` - log `"Hello World"`, if the language is `"fr"` - log `"Bonjour le monde"` etc.)

## The Age Calculator

Forgot how old you are? Calculate it!

Write a function named ` calculateAge ` that:

- Takes 2 arguments: `birthYear`, and `currentYear`.
- Calculates the 2 possible ages based on those years.
- Outputs the result: `"You are either NN or NN"`
- Call the function three times with different sets of values.

**Bonus**: Figure out how to get the current year in JavaScript instead of passing it in.

## The Lifetime Supply Calculator

Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!

Write a function named ` calculateSupply ` that:

- Takes 2 arguments: `age`, and `amountPerDay`.
- Calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
- Outputs the result to the screen like so: `"You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"`
- Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.

**Bonus**: Accept floating point values for `amountPerDay`, and round the result to a round number.

## The Geometrizer

Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here.

Create a function called ` calcCircumference `:

- Pass the `radius` to the function.
- Calculate the circumference based on the `radius`, and output `"The circumference is NN"`.

Create a function called ` calcArea `:

- Pass the `radius` to the function.
- Calculate the area based on the `radius`, and output `"The area is NN"`.

## The Temperature Converter

It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here.

Create a function called ` celsiusToFahrenheit `:

- Store a `celsius` temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to fahrenheit and output `"NN째C is NN째F"`.

Create a function called ` fahrenheitToCelsius `:

- Now store a `fahrenheit` temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to celsius and output `"NN째F is NN째C"`.

## Working with Users

Starting with this data...

```js
const users = [
  {
    email: "groucho@ga.co",
    password: "chicken",
    isAdmin: true
  },
  {
    email: "harpo@ga.co",
    password: "elephant",
    isAdmin: false
  },
  {
    email: "gummo@ga.co",
    password: "pinkFairyArmadillo",
    isAdmin: true
  },
  {
    email: "zeppo@ga.co",
    password: "dumboOctopus",
    isAdmin: false
  }
];
```

Create a function that receives an ID (index), an email and a password. If the function was provided with an email and a password that matches up, log `"You are logged in"`. Otherwise, log `"Sorry, something went wrong"`.

### Bonus: Working with Users

- Don't receive an ID! Find the user based on the email
- Make a function that creates an account. e.g. `createAccount("chico@gmail.com", "redLippedBatfish", false);`
  - This should just add another object into the array
- Make a function that deletes an account. e.g. `deleteAccount("zeppo@ga.co");`
  - This should just remove an object from the array
  - Bonus: Make this only work if the correct password was provided as a parameter too
- Make a function that updates an account. e.g. `updateAccount("harpo@ga.co", "password", "ayeAye");`
  - Bonus: Instead of receiving two strings to illustrate the change (like above), receive an object so you could potentially change multiple things at once. e.g. `updateAccount("harpo@ga.co", { password: "gharial", isAdmin: false });`
  - Bonus: Make this work only if the current password was also provided as a parameter. e.g. `updateAccount("harpo@ga.co", "elephant", { password: "gharial", isAdmin: true });`
- Add a few extra users and make a search function. I'll let you decide on the interface or the _function signature_

## A Transit Application

Start with this data...

```js
const stations = ["Museum", "St. James", "Circular Quay", "Wynyard", "Townhall", "Central", "Redfern", "Macdonaldtown", "Newtown"];
```

Create a function called `travelFrom` that receives a start station and an end station.

- Print the number of stops between the two stations. (e.g. log out "To go from 'Circular Quay' to 'Central' - you'll need to go through 2 stops")
- Print out the names of the stations on separate lines (e.g. log out "- Circular Quay", "- Wynyard", "- Townhall", "- Central")

### Bonus: A Transit Application

- Make this work if you want to go backwards! e.g. `'You want to travel from "Redfern" to "St. James"'`
- Make it error-tolerant. E.g.:
  - Make it case-insensitive - there should be no difference between `"redfern"`, `"Redfern"` and `"REDFERN"`
  - If someone passes in a station that doesn't exist, tell them
- Make it work across lines! I'll leave it up to you to create the data you need - but create arrays of multiple train lines in Sydney, and try it to get to print out the same things as above - but also things like `"Swap lines at ....."`
  - This will be very, very difficult! Don't feel like you have to add in all the lines, just a few to prove that it is working
  - Look at the hints below

#### Hints

- You can receive the name of the line! (e.g. `travelFrom("t2", "Circular Quay", "t3", "Canterbury")`)
- Find the common station! (e.g. `"t2"` and `"t3"` both have `"Central"`)
  - Maybe drawing out the lines is a good approach!
- One of the easiest approaches to this is to treat a trip across lines as two separate trips
- An object with arrays stored under the name of the train lines might be a good way to approach it (e.g. `const sydneyTrains = { t1: [], t2: [] };`
  - Note that if you want to use a variable to decide which line to access - dot notation won't work on an object! You'll have to think of another way (think square brackets!)
- Ask me questions about this if you want though!
- Work together as well - even if it is just in the planning stages
