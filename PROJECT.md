## Overview

For the final project, you'll be designing and building a web app of your choice. This project will test your knowledge of JavaScript and ask you to apply everything you've learned in this course. The result will be a web app that you can add to your portfolio. You can create anything you want! Work with your instructor to create project goals that are realistic given the scope and timing of the class.

## Technical Requirements

- Use JavaScript to correctly structure the code for a web application:

  - Ideally, structure your application to be a SPA (single page application)
    - Let JavaScript update the page!
  - Make at least one HTTP request to an API
  - Perform DOM manipulation
  - Listen for events and add interactivity based on user input
  - Optionally, use [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) or [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - you can go through the tutorial [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/start)
    - Make HTTP requests to your own Firebase URL
    - Add CRUD functionality
- Use CSS to make your page look good!
- Hosting
  - App must be hosted on either [Vercel (my favourite)](https://vercel.com/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

## Best Practices

Your instructor will provide feedback on how well you execute best practices. Even though it is not part of the requirements, you should keep these in mind:

- **Well-formatted Code** - Consistent indentation
- **Clean and Readable Code** - Follow naming conventions, comment your code and structure it well
- **Follow the F.I.R.S.T Principle** - Functions should be Focussed, Independent, Reusable, Small and Testable
- **Keep your code D.R.Y** - Don't repeat yourself!
- **Modular Code** - Separate your concerns and split functionality
- **Commit Early and Often** - Make sure you use Git and GitHub!
- **Don't put your API keys on GitHub!** - Lots of solutions for this, [this guide](https://parceljs.org/env.html) shows you how to deal with in Parcel

## Necessary Deliverables

- A **production ready web application**, SPA, hosted live on the web.
- A **new git repository hosted on Github*- where the codebase is maintained.
- Ideally, there will be a `README.md` file in your GitHub repository that explains:
  - An overview of your idea
  - A walkthrough of the code
  - Explain a technical hurdle (something you struggled with)
  - Explain some things you learned (something you enjoyed)
    - If you used technology that we haven't covered in class, provide an overview of that
  - Where next? What will you add?

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Think of a problem in the world, or even in your personal life, and apply what you've learned to build an application that can help solve the issue.
- Research your APIs as early as possible - and figure out what kind of information you can get
- Start with pseudocode
- Separate your concerns as much as possible (e.g. Data and Presentation)
- Get creative with it!
- Feel free to just copy something that already exists - don't spend time trying to reinvent the wheel
- Feel free to create a Portfolio page for yourself as the project (you could use the GitHub API!)
