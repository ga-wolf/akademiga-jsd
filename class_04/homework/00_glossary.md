# Interactive Glossary

Create an interactive glossary from the data found [here](./glossaryData.js). We want it to be searchable and filterable!

Make this look good if you have time! You have complete creative control of this one!

## Steps

### First Step

Iterate through all of the [data](./glossaryData.js) and for each item, generate some HTML from it.

### Second Step

Add search functionality! Add an input at the top of the page and a button. When you click the button, show all related definitions (use whatever the user typed in to show relevant results).

**Bonus**: Make this happen whenever the user presses a key!

### Third Step

Add filter functionality! At the top of the page, add a dropdown menu with all of the class names. When the user selects one of those classes, show all of the terms from that particular class.

**Bonus**: Make the search and filter functionality work together!

### Fourth Step

Add tag functionality! At the top of the page, have checkboxes that have the tags stored in them. When the user clicks the tags, show all relevant terms!

#### Bonus

Make the search, filter and tag functionality work together!

## Tips

- Use interpolation as much as you can
- Try and reuse as much functionality as you can
- Array methods may come in handy:
  - `.forEach`
  - `.filter`
  - `.map`
  - `.reduce`
