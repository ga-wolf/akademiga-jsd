# Exercises: Objects

## The Reading List

Keep track of which books you have read and which books you want to read!

- Create an array of objects, where each object describes a book and has properties for the title (a string), author (a string), and alreadyRead (a boolean indicating if you have read it yet).
- Iterate through that array of books
  - For each book, log the book title and book author like so: "'Sapiens', by Yuval Noah Harari".
- Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether you read it yet or not.
  - If you have read it, log a string like `'You have already read "Sapiens", by Yuval Noah Harari'`
  - If not, log a string like `'You still need to read "A Life on Our Planet", by David Attenborough.'`"

## The Recipe Card

Never forget another recipe!

Create an object to hold information on your favorite recipe. It should have properties for a title (a string), a number of servings, and ingredients (an array of strings).

On separate lines log the recipe information so it looks like this:

```raw
Ginger, Apple and Banana Smoothie

Serves: 2

Ingredients:

- 500ml Milk
- 2/3 cups of vanilla protein powder
- 2 tbs rolled oats
- Pinch of cinnamon
- 2 cups of baby spinach leaves
- 2 frozen bananas
- 2 roughly chopped apples
- 1/2 avocado
- 2 tsp fresh ginger
- 6 ice cubes
```

## The Movie Database

It's like IMDB, but much much smaller!

- Create an object to store the following information about your favorite movie: title (a string), duration (a number), director (a string) and stars (an array of strings).
- Print out the movie information like so: "'The Life Aquatic' lasts for 118 minutes, and was directed by Wes Anderson. Stars: Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, Jeff Goldblum and Willem Dafoe."
